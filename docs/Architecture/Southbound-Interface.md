## Summary of Southbound API

Southbound API is an interface expected by Provisioner. This interface provides a mechanism for interaction across Provisioner and interacting components.

The basis of such interactions would be a `setup.yaml` file that is maintained by each participating component under `/opt/seagate/cortx/<component>/conf/setup.yaml`.

This file has the following structure:

## `setup.yaml` File Sections Explained

* **The root node (`<component>`)**: is the name of the component. This has to be same as the name mentioned in `/opt/seagate/cortx/<component>/conf/setup.yaml`.

Each of the sub-sections (unless mentioned explicitly) will have the following parameters:

  * `script`:  Script to be executed provided by component pertaining to this section.
  * `args`:  A list of arguments (in YAML format) to be passed to the script.

Supported **Sub-sections** for `<component>` root node are listed below:

* `post_install`:  This section is called after the component rpm is installed from config `.sls`.

* `config`: This section shall follow the post_install and is intended to allow components to update/adjust the configurations according to local environments.

* `init`: This section has a purpose to initialize the component (i.e. mark it ready) for service. This shall complete the configuration of the component.  This would be post the `config` stage.

* `test`: This section should have scripts to validate the state of the component, i.e. to ensure component sanity post deployment. This would be post the `init` stage.

* `reset`: A reset script is supposed to cleanup the component after itself for any critical/non-critical data before the component package (rpm) is uninstalled.

* `backup`: Backup section is slightly different as here we don't execute any scripts.  However, Provisioner would use a mechanism define in custom execution module `sync.py` to backup files (and restore when required).
  * `files`: The list of files to be backed-up. The same list would be used as a reference for restore.  If a file specified in this list is missing, it would be skipped with a warning in `/var/log/seagate/provisioner/salt-minion.log`.

* `refresh_config`: Refresh config section would be used by the component to correct any deviations in config file detected by the component, which would have a detrimental impact on the service provided by the component.

`support_bundle`: This is a special section used by [`cortx-manager`](https://github.com/Seagate/cortx-manager) to locate the script provided by the component for generating component specific support_bundle.

**NOTE**: Any section left blank in `setup.yaml` would be neglected. `refresh_config` as of the time of writing is only called in `deploy_replacement` script on request by the components.
