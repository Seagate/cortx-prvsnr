# Provisioner API

This is a northbound interface for CORTX components that provides API
to configure provisioned software stack.

It uses saltstack client python API and should be called on the same machine where
salt-master is running.


There are set of api levels:
1. [base python api](#api) that communicates directly with underlying salt api
2. provisioner [cli tool](#cli)
3. python api that uses provisioner cli and acts as a thin alternative for base one


The one may choose an api depending it their needs:
* base python api is the best choice for python libraries and apps since
  it can be utilized in usual way
* python api over cli might be the better for python apps that are going
  to be frozen since it doesn't have other python dependencies than system ones
* cli is to be consumed by any non-python app & library as usual shell tool


## Requirements

1. Should be called on the same machine where salt-master is running
2. External auth for salt should be [respected](#authentication_initialization)


## Installation

### From GitLab

```
    pip install  git+http://github.com/Seagate/cortx-prvsnr#subdirectory=api/python
```

Will install `dev` branch version.
To install specific `version` (it might be any branch, tag or commit sha1):

```
    pip install  git+http://github.com/Seagate/cortx-prvsnr@version#subdirectory=api/python
```

SSH based installation is also possible, e.g.

```
    pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/Seagate/cortx-prvsnr.git#subdirectory=api/python
```

### From yum repository

The API is now bundled as part of provisioner rpm package `cortx-prvsnr`.

During the installation the api package is placed in `/opt/seagate/cortx/provisioner/api/python` directory.

Also it is installed to global python3 environment and available for usual python imports.


## Configuration


### Switching Python API

By default base Provisioner Python API is enabled. To switch to Python CLI wrapper:


```
import provisioner

provisioner.set_api('pycli')
```


### Authentication Initialization

To be used by non-root user the API requires additional initialization:

```
import provisioner

provisioner.auth_init(username=username, password=password)
```

where `username` is a name of the user that is added to `prvsnrusers` group.
So you should either add and existent user to that group or create new one and
pass his name along with his password to `auth_init`.

## API

*TODO*

## Output

Supported output formats:
  - plain
  - json
  - yaml

Might be configured using (from lower to higher precedence):
  - environment variable `PRVSNR_OUTPUT`, defaults to `plain`
  - cli tool option `--output`, defaults to `PRVSNR_OUTPUT` env variable value

## Logging

Supported logging handlers (might be combined):
- `console`: logs to either `stdout` or `stderr`
- `rsyslog`: logs to rsyslog
- `logfile`: logs to specified file with log rotation

Supported logging formats:
- `human` human friendly format oriented on progress output
- `full` rich logging format with many fields good for logs exploration and debugging

Ways of configuration:
- configuration file (from lower to higher precedence):
    - hardcoded logging configuration
    - `<api package installation directory>/provisioner.conf`
- cli tool options (overides configuration file options):
    - common for all handlers:
        - `--<handler>` - enables a `<handler>`
        - `--no<handler>` - disables a `<handler>`
        - `--<handler>-level {DEBUG|INFO|WARN|ERROR}` - sets logging level for a `<handler>`
        - `--<handler>-formatter {human|full}` - sets logging format for a `<handler>`
    - specific:
        - `--console-stream {stderr|stdout}`
        - `--logfile-filename <path>` path to a log file
        - `--logfile-maxBytes <bytes>` max file size in bytes
        - `--logfile-backupCount <number>` max backup log files number

### Default settings

Provisioner confiuration file:
- `console` handler:
    - enabled
    - log format is `human`
    - log level is `INFO`
    - log stream is `stderr`
- `rsyslog` handler:
    - enabled
    - log format is `full`
    - log level is `DEBUG`
- `logfile` handler:
    - disabled
    - log format is `full`
    - log level is `DEBUG`
    - `filename` is `./prvsnr-api.log`
    - `maxBytes` is `10485760` (`10 MB`)
    - `backupCount` is `10`

Hardcoded configuration (used if no configuation file is found):
- `console` handler is enabled with `full` format and `DEBUG` level

### Additional CLI logging rules

1. if `output` is set to machine readable one (`json`, `yaml`) then `console`
   handler is disabled
2. if api command is one of `LOG_FORCED_LOGFILE_CMDS` in [config.py](provisioner/config.py) then:
    - `logfile` handler is enabled
    - if no value for `filename` is provided then it is generated. Genarated
      files are located in either `/var/log/seagate/provisioner` or in the current
      directory if the former doesn't exist.


## Usage examples

### Integration with apps going to be frozen

Please use python api over cli if you use some python freezer to distribute
your application (e.g. [pyinstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/)).

There is a helper module `provisioner.freeze` that you might want to import
to make the integration easier:

```
    import provisioner
    import provisioner.freeze

    pillar = provisioner.pillar_get()
    ...
```


### NTP configuration

```
    from provisioner import get_params, set_ntp

    # get current values
    curr_params = get_params('ntp_server', 'ntp_timezone')

    api_ntp_server = curr_params['ntp_server']
    api_ntp_timezone = curr_params['ntp_timezone']

    # set new ones
    new_ntp_server = '0.north-america.pool.ntp.org'
    new_ntp_timezone = 'Europe/Berlin'

    set_ntp(server=new_ntp_server, timezone=new_ntp_timezone)
```

## CLI

Provisioner provides CLI tool `provisioner` that allows one to interact with system configuration manager
via shell.

### CLI Installation

The tool `provisioner` becomes available once the provisioner api module is [installed](#installation)
in your system or python virtual environtment.

### CLI Usage

CLI wraps provisioner api. Please refer to its usage help `provisioner --help` for more details.

#### Passing crdedentials to CLI

To pass authnetication for non-root users you will likely need to provider credentials to CLI.
There are multiple options how to do that:
1. using stdin: `echo <password> | provisioner --username <username> --password -`
2. as env variable `PRVSNR_PASSWORD`: `PRVSNR_PASSWORD=<password> provisioner --username <username>`
3. (insecure) as command line argument: `provisioner --username <username> --password <password>`
