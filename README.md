# CORTX-Provisioner

The process of setting up your IT Infrastrucure is called Provisioning. Provisioining involves managing access to data and resources to make these available to users and systems. Resource deoployment is a two-step process where you provision and then configure the resource. To set up the CORTX project, you'll need to provision your:

- Server 
- Network 
- Service 

The main feature of the CORTX-Provisioner is to:
- Let you provision your environments such as Dev, QA, Lab, and Production with minimal user intervention.
- Allow you to maintain the modularity or granularity of during various stages of Provisioning process so as to help enhancements, maintainability, and training with minimal collateral impacts
