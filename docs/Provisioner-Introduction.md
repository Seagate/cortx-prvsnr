## Operations Performed by Provisioner

CORTX stack goes through certain stages in it's lifecycle.  Below is the diagram which highlights some of these stages, related to and managed by Provisioner.

![lifecycle](diagrams/lifecycle/lifecycle.png)

* Initial Provisioning: [Auto-Deploy-Provisioner-CLI-Commands](https://github.com/Seagate/cortx-prvsnr/wiki/Auto-Deploy-Provisioner-CLI-Commands).
  * For reference -- manual for VM-based environment: [Auto-Deploy-VM-Provisioner-CLI-Commands](https://github.com/Seagate/cortx-prvsnr/wiki/Auto-Deploy-VM-Provisioner-CLI-Commands).
* Boxing & Un-Boxing: [Box-Unbox](https://github.com/Seagate/cortx-prvsnr/wiki/Box-Unbox).
* CSM On-Boarding: [CORTX Management Portal Quick Start](https://github.com/Seagate/cortx-management-portal/blob/main/docs/CortxManagementPortalQuickstart.md), sections Preboarding and Onboarding.
* Fail-over -- is managed by HA.  No doc available.
* Node Replacement: [Node-Replacement](https://github.com/Seagate/cortx-prvsnr/wiki/Node-Replacement).
  * Extra docs by HA (not sure how relevant):

## How Provisioner Interacts With Other Components

### Northbound Interface

Provisioner exposes an API which other components may use to run certain operations through Provisioner.

Main page: [Northbound-Interface](Architecture/Northbound-Interface.md).

This API is exposed in 3 forms:

* Library (python module).
* CLI (main entry point is command-line utility called `provisioner`; run `provisioner --help` for list of available commands).
* CLI-wrapper library. It's a python module, but it's "decoupled" from main library listed above, and does not inherit external dependencies/imports on other modules (which main library has).  This allows for special strict linkage of this python module, e.g. in a form of python frozen app (dependencies are minimized in this case).


### Southbound Interface

This is an interface which must be supported by every CORTX component to enable it with Provisioner.

Main page: [Southbound-Interface](Architecture/Southbound-Interface.md).

In a nutshell: Provisioner defines certain stages/actions (e.g. post-install, or config update), and every component defines (in `setup.yaml`) which component-specific commands must be run during a given stage by Provisioner.
