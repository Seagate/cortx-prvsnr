## Overview

Test Design implementation is written in PyTest tool in Provisioner. The scope of this design proposal is to serve as a guide to write future test cases under a disciplined structure. This design, however, is valid for Integration tests only and, the Unit testcases will go into a separate unit test folder created under each corresponding sub-directory.

## PyTest Framework

PyTest is full-featured Python testing tool currently implemented in Provisioner.  
It is installed along with other dependencies as part of `test-requirements.txt` file execution. The latest installed version is 5.1.x.  
Execute the test cases in the directory with the command,

```
python3 -m pytest <test_case>
```

In the current directory and its subdirectories, PyTest will run all test files as:

```
test_*.py
```
**Execute Multiple test cases as a Group:**

A group of test cases can be run together by placing them under a common “marker” name or by a common string in the method name as `test_deploy` or file name as `test_deploy.py`.

```
python3 -m pytest -m <marker> -s
```

OR

```
python3 -m pytest -k <string> -s
```

A better approach would be to follow the use of string in file name, as we have better control in grouping all related-test cases together.

## Proposed Directory Design

* The proposed design will not deviate a lot from the existing architecture, instead will only aim to streamline some scattered tests. This design will be updated/changed based on further discussions and design requirements.

* The idea is to create a "Suite"-like design which will group all the related test cases and execute.


### Integration Tests

**Design Features**
* A Test Case (TC) must be the smallest functional element and should not combine multiple logic together. For instance, test cases implemented specific to bootstrap functionality must not include other functionalities.

* All individual TestCases must follow the below naming convention:
  * Start with “test_ “, followed by corresponding test suite name, followed by the function they represent, followed by test case definition.
  * Ex: `test_deploy_bootstrap_ssh`, `test_deploy_bootstrap_configure`, etc.  
  
    **Format:**
    ```
    test_<testsuite>_<function>_<definition>
    ```

* A Test Suite (TS) can be broken down to multiple other test suites based on the functions it represents and need not contain “test_ “ in its name.

* A Test Module (TM) is an even larger collection of test suites and will form the root parent folder structure and need not contain “test_ “ in its name.

* Test Suite and Test Module are always directories and Test Case is a python file with one or more methods implemented.

* Each Test Suite (sub-directories) may contain a config file `pytest.ini` which would ideally contain the file names inside that directory. 
  * This is an option to make testing easier. As we add or remove more files in future to a particular directory, the file names can be listed here and only those would be executed. 
  * Removing any file name from `pytest.ini` will not have an overall effect in execution of that Test Module. This is only for testing the methods in given Test Suite. 
  * Example, say a Test Suite (sub-directory named `pre_deploy`) has 5 files, and only 2 have to be tested new, then it can included as,
  
    ```
    [pytest]
    python_files = test_network_checks.py test_env_setup.py
    
    ```
    **Execution:**  
    
    ```
    [root@xxx pre_deploy]# ls
    __pycache__  pytest.ini  test_driver_setup.py  test_env_setup.py  test_network_checks.py  test_storage_checks.py  test_ssh.py

    ```

* Additionally, PyTest also provides another default config file - `conftest.py`, which is used to import test fixture function to be used in multiple test files and to import external plugins or modules.
  * It is ideally present in the test/ root folder and can be used to ignore any files from being considered for testing. 
  * This would be useful in case of exclusion of framework-specific files like `setup.py` which is not necessary to include in PyTest execution.
  
* *NOTE:* All the test names are sample and design ideas are liable to more changes.


**Test Hierarchy and Design**

For Integration tests, here are the formats of Test Framework Hierarchy and Design.

**A more scrutinized format of this hierarchy:**

**Sample Folder Structure** 

The existing `test/` folder can look similar to this format.

```
test
├── api/python
│   └── deploy
│   │   └── deploy_setup
│   │      ├── bootstrap
│   │      │   └── test_deploy_bootstrap_ssh.py
│   │      │   ├── pytest.ini
│   │      │   └── deploy_unittest
│   │      └── setup_prvsnr
│   │          └── setup_env
│   │          ├── pytest.ini
│   │          └── setup_prvsnr_unittest
│   └── sw_update
│   │   └── sw_update_setup
│   │       ├── sw_update_repo
│   │       │   └── test_configure_repo.py
│   │       ├── pytest.ini
│   │       └── sw_update_unittest
│   └── repl_node
│       └── repl_node_setup
│           ├── m5_user_profile
│           │   └── test_m5_verify_alias.py
│           ├── pytest.ini
│           └── repl_node_unittest
├── cli/src
│    └── factory_pkg
│       └── boxing
│       │   ├── test_boxing_ctrl_ip_validate.py
│       │   ├── pytest.ini
│       │   └── boxing_unittest
│       └── unboxing
│           ├── test_unboxing_status.py
│           ├── pytest.ini
│           └── unboxing_unittest
├── srv/components
│   └── configuration
│       └── setup_minion
│           ├── test_salt_validate_minions.py
│           ├── pytest.ini
│           └── setup_minion_unittest
└── conftest.py

```

With the above design structure, execution of deploy-related test cases can be either one of the following ways, 

```
python3 -m pytest -m deploy -s
```

OR

```
pytest deploy/
```
For specific execution of deploy-bootstrap-related test cases, 

```
python3 -m pytest -m bootstrap -s
```

OR

```
pytest deploy/bootstrap/
```

OR

```
cd deploy/bootstrap
pytest
```

### Unit Tests 

This proposed design is more suited for Integration Tests, so the Unit Tests can either be placed under a separate `unittest` folder created for each group as explained in the above Design diagram or can be placed under the existing mirrored architecture in `test/` folder.
