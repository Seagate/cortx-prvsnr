# Functions in this file address following:
#   1. Stop rabbitmq cluster, if running
#   2. Ref: Stop and restart a RabbitMQ cluster, RMQ clustering 
#   3. Ensure Lnet service is stopped 
#   4. Collect system-wide support bundle using CSM CLI interface
#   5. Backup files 
#       a. /etc/multipath/bindings 
#       b. /etc/multipath.conf 
#   6. Unmount /var/mero and SWAP? (This should be ideally taken care of by OS shutdown)
#   7. Cleanup /tmp 
#   8. Create boxing flag file on primary node:
#       /opt/seagate/eos-prvsnr/generated_config/boxed
#       Creating file on only one node ensures that the unboxing is executed only on primary node.
