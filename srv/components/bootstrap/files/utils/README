1.  eos-bootstrap.sh

    Run the script eos-bootstrap.sh to configure the mero
    object store cluster.

    If using this script on vm or on single node cluster then
    ensure that the "single_node_cluster" varibale  is set to
    "yes" in eos-defs.sh file in the same directory.

    usage:
    eos-bootstrap.sh [-y] [-c <mini-eos-config-file.yaml]
        [-e <data network interface> [-E mgmt network interface>]

    The sample mini config file is provided in the config direc-
    tory, it can be used with the eos-vm which has 12 virtual
    disks.

    Option -y is for non interactive mode, it is recommended only
    if you want to perform selective steps of cluster configurat-
    ion. Using it without complete knowledge may make the cluster
    offline or non recoverable mode.

    If mini-eos-config-file is provided to the script then n/w
    interfaces provided are used for creating other config files.
    If no network interfaces are provided, then the any one n/w
    interface with ip address assigned to it will be used for both
    data and management interfaces.

    Data interface is used for read write from mero object store
    Management interface is used for communication between cluster
    nodes and services.


    Following are various scenarios where the scirpt can be used:

    1. After packages are installed, run it to configure the clu-
       ster with following options:

       $ eos-bootstrap.sh -y -c mini-config-file.yaml -e eth0

       Before running the command, ensure that mini-config-file
       has the correct hostnames and the disks mentioned in it
       actually exists.

       If you are running this script on vm, then no need to pro-
       vide management interface, the network interface provided
       for data will be used for management interface by default.

    2. Re-bootstrap the cluster.

       Warning: Re-bootstrap erases all the data stored on the ob-
       ject store.

       If the cluster goes in unrecoverable state due to seom reas-
       on. This script can be used to re-bootstrap/re-configure the
       cluster without creating or changing the config files.
       Simply run:

       $eos-bootstrap.sh -y

       This will stop the cluster (if running) and start it again.
       If the configuration needs to be changed, run the scirpt as
       mentioned in scenario 1.

2. eos-cleanup.sh

       Run this script to cleanup all the eos configuratoin data.
       This will cleanup all mero and halon config data stored
       under /var/mero and /var/lib/halon/. It will however retain
       the halon facts file, lnet config file and halon conf file.

       To run this script with non interactive mode

       $ /opt/seagate/eos/utils/eos-cleanup.sh -y

       This will erase all the data stored on the eos.
